Highlight.js library, from https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js

Documentation at:
http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/

Build directions:

1. Download the source from either of the links above

2. Move the source folder to /vendor. The directory structure should look
   exactly like like
      vendor/
        |
        +-highlight.js/
            |
            +- src/
            +- tools/
            +- ....

3. cd to the highlight.js/ directory

4. Build the library with the following command:

	$python2.7 tools/build.py -t browser coffeescript css javascript json python xml

   This should put a highlight.pack.js file in the newly created build/ directory

5. highlight.pack.js and github.css (in /src/styles/) are currently referenced
   by the build.config.js file at the root of this repository. To change the
   styling, just reference a different stylesheet.
